The data this week comes from the Wikipedia List of the verified oldest people. The data was created by **frankiethull** on GitHub.[^1]

> These are lists of the 100 known verified oldest people sorted in descending order by age in years and days.
>
>The oldest person ever whose age has been independently verified is Jeanne Calment (1875–1997) of France, who lived to the age of 122 years and 164 days.[b] The oldest verified man ever is Jiroemon Kimura (1897–2013) of Japan, who lived to the age of 116 years and 54 days.
>
>The oldest known living person is Maria Branyas of Spain, aged 116 years, 88 days. The oldest known living man is Juan Vicente Pérez of Venezuela, aged 114 years, 4 days. The 100 oldest women have, on average, lived several years longer than the 100 oldest men.

## Libraries

```{r, library, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(showtext)
library(showtextdb)
library(patchwork)
library(camcorder)
library(ggtext)
library(glue)

```

## Data

```{r, data, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# tuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2023, week = 22)

# centenarians <- tuesdata$centenarians %>%
#   write_csv(path = "data/centenarians.csv")

centenarians <- read_csv("data/centenarians.csv") 


```

## Loading Fonts

I have been in love with the Quicksand font of late. I think it's simple, and easy on the eyes and it doesn't look either too formal or too casual. I hope my interpretation of the font is correct because I have been using it for some important documents. 


```{r, fonts, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}


font_add_google("Quicksand", "Quicksand")
showtext_auto()

```

## Make Events Data

The actual plot with the data is going to be a timeline showing the lifespan of the longest living individual, Jeanne Calment. Calment lived in Provence, France from 1875 to 1997. Add to this life span are the major events during that time span, such as the world wars. This based on the work of Nicola Rennie <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@nrennie">*nrennie* on Mastadon</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/nrennie35?lang=en">*nrennie35* on Twitter</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/nrennie">*nrennie* on Github</a>. I chose their work because of the timeline nature of the viz. I have been looking for a good way to show a timeline viz using `ggplot` and I think this is it.
