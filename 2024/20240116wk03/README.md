# TidyTuesday 2024 - Week 03

This week we have data on US Polling Stations.

> The dataset comes from The Center for Public Integrity. You can read more about the data and how it was collected in their September 2020 article "National data release sheds light on past polling place changes". Thank you Kelsey E Gonzalez for the dataset suggestion back in 2020! (Hughes et al., 2019)

## Chart Types

- The first chart I craeted is like a street sign. Ryan Heart suggests creating a modified version 
  - Saved as *pollingstations21012024.png*

- The second chart I created is a proportional symbol map of the polling locations in California during the November 03, 2020 elections.

## NOTES ON MAPPING

**C**oordinate **R**eference **S**ystem (i.e., CRS). In layman's term, map projections try to transform the earth from its spherical shape (3D) to a planar shape (2D). A coordinate reference system (CRS) then defines how the two-dimensional, projected map in your GIS relates to real places on the earth. The .prj file normally contains the CRS for a shapefile.
After doing some Google, I found that, projecting the polygon to **WGS84** works, especially when using the sf package. It is described as being more striaight forward than the {rgdal} package[^1].
