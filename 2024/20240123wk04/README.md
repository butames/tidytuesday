# TidyTuesday 2024 - Week 04

This week were have data from the Educational attainment of young people in English towns. The data comes from the UK Office for National Statistics (). The data was alws discussed estivesly in the article, [Why do children and young people in smaller towns do better academically than those in larger towns?](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/educationandchildcare/articles/whydochildrenandyoungpeopleinsmallertownsdobetteracademicallythanthoseinlargertowns/2023-07-25)

This week I am attempting to recreate the **100% Horizontal Stacked Bar Chart?** used in the article. This type of chart is a great way of displaying data data, allowing you to compare multiple categories. I have often seen it used when representing data from survey scales, where you have multiple sub groups in one larger category.

The article represented the data as follows:
