# TidyTuesday 2024 - Week 05

This week we are using data on Groundhog predictions. There is a common traddition in mainly NE US like Pennsylvannia, where tradition employs a Groundhog to predict the end of winter. Festivals have built up around this festival and in Pennsylvania the famous Punxsutawney Phil is the official harbinger of Spring.

> See if you can find a better way to present the annual data than their table of predictions by year! For anyone not familiar with the Groundhog Day tradition, if the groundhog sees its shadow and goes back into its burrow, that is a prediction of six more weeks of winter. Otherwise spring will come early. We attempted to provide weather data to accompany this dataset, but so far we've been unsuccessful. Watch for a follow-up dataset in the future!
