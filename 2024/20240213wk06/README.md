# TidyTuesday 2024 - Week 06

This week we are using Valentin's Day Consumer Data from the National Retail Federation Valentine's Day Data Center.

> The NRF has surveyed consumers about how they plan to celebrate Valentine’s Day annually for over a decade. Take a deeper dive into the data from the last 10 years, and use the interactive charts to explore a demographic breakdown of total spending, average spending, types of gifts planned and spending per type of gift.
