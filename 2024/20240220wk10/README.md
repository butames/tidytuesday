This week we are using the **Trash Wheel Collection Data** sourced from the [Health Harbor Trash Wheel Data Collection Program](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b8Lbe-z3PNb3H8nSsSjrwK2B0ReAblL2/edit#gid=1143432795)


A code snippet for creating a gif using the `gg_playback()` function from the `{camcorder}` package.
```
gg_playback(
  name = file.path("2024", "2024-02-20", paste0("20240220", ".gif")),
  first_image_duration = 4,
  last_image_duration = 20,
  frame_duration = .25,
  background = bkgcol
)
```
