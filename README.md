  &nbsp;#Experimenting with TidyTuesday&nbsp;
</h1>

This repository presents an opportunity to play around with TidyTuesday data and to create data visualizations, using R/ R Studio and various data viz packages. Presently, I intend to duplicate some of the more exciting visuals I have seen on the internet using my own flare. With time and practice, I hope I, too, will become a data viz wiz. Occassionally, I will try to veer into other data viz creation tools such as D3 and Tableau. I have already used Tableau to some extent and am onversant with it. Who knows, if there is time on my hands (I doubt it) I will pick up Python.
