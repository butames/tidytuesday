  &nbsp;Experimenting with TidyTuesday&nbsp;
</h1>

<p>
This repository presents an opportunity to play around with the data from the [TidyTuesday Challenge](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) in order to create data visualizations. I am hoping to become more adept at data wrangling, cleaning, and presentation using R/ R Studio and various data viz packages (e.g. D3 and Tableau). Presently, I intend to duplicate some of the more exciting visuals I have seen on the internet using my own flare. With time and practice, I hope to become a data viz wiz. Occassionally, I will try to veer into other data viz creation tools such as D3 and Tableau. I have already used Tableau to some extent and am onversant with it. Who knows, if there is time on my hands (I doubt it) I will pick up Python.

The [TidyTuesday Challenge](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) produces a weekly social data project that focuses on a variety of data related topics including wrangling, and making of charts and graphs. Those behind the project encourage the use of R/RStudio packages such as the `{tidyverse}` suite of pacakges (e.g., `{ggplot2}` & `{dplyr}`), and many more. The project was started in 2018 by [Thomas Mack](https://thomasmock.netlify.com/) and it is organized by the [R for Data Science (R4DS) online learning community](https://twitter.com/r4dscommunity)
