# CHALLENGE 04 - The Georgia Negro (plate 01), February 26

## LIBRARY

1. {tidytuesdayR} -- Access 'TidyTuesday' Weekly Projects
2. {tidyverse} --  A collection of open source packages for the R programming language
3. {showtext} -- Using Fonts More Easily in R Graphs
4. {sf} -- Support for simple features, a standardized way to encode spatial vector data
5. {ggtext} -- Create Chicklet (Rounded Segmented Column) Charts
6. {camcorder} --
7. {glue} --


This one will prove to be a bit difficult. I struggle to use the {sf} package. Mostly because I am just getting a grasp of its function. However, I think I understand what is to be done. I am showing a world map that focuses on the exploitation routes that carried enslaved black folk from continental Africa (sub-saharan) to continental United States specifically Georgia, as shown by the star. I think I understand the basic steps so we shall see how long this will take me.
