The goal is to reproduce **plate 13** developed by W.E.B Du Bois  for the 1900 Paris Exposition.

## LIBRARY

This seems like a very simplistic project (relative to the previous week). The {tidyverse} package, should suffice.

```{r, library, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(showtext)
library(janitor)

```

## IMPORT DATA

```{r, data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

df1 <- read_csv("data/data.csv")

```
