The goal this week is to reproduce **plate 47** developed by W.E.B Du Bois  for the 1900 Paris Exposition (as shown below).

## LIBRARY

This week, the challenge is fairly straight-forward. We are dealing with a horizontal bar chart (i.e., categories on the y-axis, and integers on the x-axis). So I am mostly relying on `{ggplot2}` within `{tidyverse}` suite of packages. I will also use the janitor package. I typically use the `clean_names()` function, to ensure the variable names are entered consistently. I am also using the `{showtext}` and the `{ggtext}` packages to help with using outside fonts. 


```{r, library, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(showtext)
library(ggtext)

```


## SET TEXT RESOLUTION


```{r, text, message=TRUE, warning=FALSE}

showtext_auto()

showtext_opts(dpi = 320, regular.wt = 300, bold.wt = 800)

```

## LOAD FONTS

For the Du Bois challenges I have been using the **Exo 2** font available through [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Exo+2?query=exo+2). This font was designed by [Natanael Gama](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Natanael+Gama). It is a font that somewhat approximates the font used by Du Bois for all chart plates.

However *plate 47* for Challenge 07 is using a different font, which looks more like fonts used by more modern typewritters of the 20th Century. I think that stand typewriter font is in the Courier family. However, Courier Prime, the Google Font version is not quite right. The closest approximation I found was the **Cutive Mono**, others that may work include **Lekton**, and **Kosugi Maru**. **Cutive Mono** is available from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cutive+Mono?query=cutive+mon) and is Designed by [Vernon Adams](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Vernon+Adams).

I continue to use [**Font Aweseome**](https://fontawesome.com/icons) to import icons into my plot.

```{r fonts, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

font_add("fa6-brands", "Users/seyramb/Library/Fonts/Font Awesome 6 Brands-Regular-400.otf") 
font_add_google("Cutive Mono", "title")
font_add_google("Cutive Mono", "subtitle")
font_add_google("Cutive Mono", "caption")
font_add_google("Cutive Mono", "text")

```

## TITLES & CAPTIONS

```{r, title, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
tt <- str_glue("Du Bois Challenge: { 2024 } Week { 07 } &vert; Source: Allen Hillery and Sekou Tyler<br>")
X  <- str_glue("<span style='font-family:fa6-brands'>&#xe61b;</span>")   
gh <- str_glue("<span style='font-family:fa6-brands'>&#xf09b;</span>")
mn <- str_glue("<span style='font-family:fa6-brands'>&#xf4f6;</span>")

ttltxt <- str_glue("Illiteracy of the American Negro compared with other nations.")
subtxt <- str_glue("Proportion d' illettres parmi le Negres Americans comparee a celle des autres nations<br>Done by Atlanta University.")
captxt <- str_glue("{tt} Visualization: {X} @butames &bull; {mn} @butames(mastodon.cloud) Code: {gh} butames &bull; Tools: #rstats #ggplot2")

```

## ADD COLORS

There are four colors used on this plate, there is the brown of the background, the black of the text, and the green and dark red used in the bars of the chart. Interestingly because these plates were prepared by hand in an era when there was no digital chart creation, it appears to be colored in or painted in. So part of the beauty of some of these data charts is the  produced by painting or hand drawing.

```{r, color, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Background Color

bkgcol <- "#DCC6B3"

# Text Color

ttlcol <- "#000000"
subcol <- "#000000"
capcol <- "#000000"
txtcol <- "#000000"

# Chart Colors

palette <- c("#2C8657", "#B90021")

```

## DEFINE THEME

Define the theme. I have found this approach useful in the past, so I continue here.

```{r, theme, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

theme_set(theme_minimal(base_size = 12, base_family = "text"))
theme_update(
  plot.title.position   = "plot",
  plot.caption.position = "plot",
  axis.title.x          = element_text(margin = margin(t = 10, r = 0, b = 0, l = 0), size = rel(1), color = txtcol, family = "text", face = "bold"),
  axis.title.y          = element_text(margin = margin(t = 0, r = 10, b = 0, l = 0), size = rel(1), color = txtcol, family = "text", face = "bold"),
  axis.text             = element_blank(),
  axis.line.x           = element_blank(),
  panel.grid.minor.y    = element_blank(),
  panel.grid.major.y    = element_blank(),
  panel.grid.minor.x    = element_blank(),
  panel.grid.major.x    = element_blank(),
  plot.margin           = margin(t = 10, r = 10, b = 10, l = 10),
  plot.background       = element_rect(fill = bkgcol, color = bkgcol),
  panel.background      = element_rect(fill = bkgcol, color = bkgcol)
)

```

## DATA

The team that prepared the data, created a side note going forward.

> This chart has no units, so extrapilating the illiteracy rate of Black Americans in the 1890 Census (56.8%, source "Excerpts are taken from Chapter 1 of 120 Years of American Education: A Statistical Portrait (Edited by Tom Snyder, National Center for Education Statistics, 1993).", https://nces.ed.gov/naal/lit_history.asp).
> 
> 56.8% -- 8.8cm on the chart yields 6.45454 illitercy points/cm. by measuring the length of each bar (recorded in ill.d), you can compute the illiteracy points:
> Romaine, 72.9363
>
> Servie, 72.2908
>
> Russie, 72.2908
>
> "Negroes, U.S.A.",56.8
>
> Hongrie, 55.509
>
> Italie, 43.8909
>
> Autriche, 34.8545
>
> Ireland, 25.1727
>
> France, 12.9091
>
> Suede, 0.645454


```{r, data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

df1 <- read_csv("data/data.csv") %>%
  clean_names()

```


## SAVE FIGURE

```{r, save, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# ggsave(paste0("challenge07_", format(Sys.time(), "%d%m%Y"), ".png"), dpi = 320, height=11, width = 8.5, limitsize = F)


```
