The goal this week is to reproduce **plate 47** developed by W.E.B Du Bois  for the 1900 Paris Exposition (as shown below).

## LIBRARY

This week, the challenge is fairly straight-forward. We are dealing with a horizontal bar chart (i.e., categories on the y-axis, and integers on the x-axis). So I am mostly relying on `{ggplot2}` within `{tidyverse}` suite of packages. I will also use the janitor package. I typically use the `clean_names()` function, to ensure the variable names are entered consistently. I am also using the `{showtext}` and the `{ggtext}` packages to help with using outside fonts. 


```{r, library, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(showtext)
library(ggtext)

```


## SET TEXT RESOLUTION


```{r, text, message=TRUE, warning=FALSE}

showtext_auto()

showtext_opts(dpi = 320, regular.wt = 300, bold.wt = 800)

```

## LOAD FONTS

For the Du Bois challenges I have been using the **Exo 2** font available through [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Exo+2?query=exo+2). This font was designed by [Natanael Gama](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Natanael+Gama). It is a font that somewhat approximates the font used by Du Bois for all chart plates.

However *plate 47* for Challenge 07 is using a different font, which looks more like fonts used by more modern typewritters of the 20th Century. I think that stand typewriter font is in the Courier family. However, Courier Prime, the Google Font version is not quite right. The closest approximation I found was the **Cutive Mono**, others that may work include **Lekton**, and **Kosugi Maru**. **Cutive Mono** is available from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cutive+Mono?query=cutive+mon) and is Designed by [Vernon Adams](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Vernon+Adams).

I continue to use [**Font Aweseome**](https://fontawesome.com/icons) to import icons into my plot.

```{r fonts, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

font_add("fa6-brands", "Users/seyramb/Library/Fonts/Font Awesome 6 Brands-Regular-400.otf") 
font_add_google("Cutive Mono", "title")
font_add_google("Cutive Mono", "subtitle")
font_add_google("Cutive Mono", "caption")
font_add_google("Cutive Mono", "text")

```

## TITLES & CAPTIONS

```{r, title, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
tt <- str_glue("Du Bois Challenge: { 2024 } Week { 07 } &vert; Source: Allen Hillery and Sekou Tyler<br>")
X  <- str_glue("<span style='font-family:fa6-brands'>&#xe61b;</span>")   
gh <- str_glue("<span style='font-family:fa6-brands'>&#xf09b;</span>")
mn <- str_glue("<span style='font-family:fa6-brands'>&#xf4f6;</span>")

ttltxt <- str_glue("Illiteracy of the American Negro compared with other nations.")
subtxt <- str_glue("Proportion d' illettres parmi le Negres Americans comparee a celle des autres nations<br>Done by Atlanta University.")
captxt <- str_glue("{tt} Visualization: {X} @butames &bull; {mn} @butames(mastodon.cloud) Code: {gh} butames &bull; Tools: #rstats #ggplot2")

```

## SAVE FIGURE

```{r, save, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# ggsave(paste0("challenge07_", format(Sys.time(), "%d%m%Y"), ".png"), dpi = 320, height=11, width = 8.5, limitsize = F)
