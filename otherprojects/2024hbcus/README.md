# Summary of HBCUS

I wanted to try my hands at creating a summary table of HBCUs. I saw a lovely interractive table created in Tableau and I am nearly certain I can create something similar there. However, I want to see if I can create something similar in R (i.e., gt package or the {reactable} package).
The data for this exercis comes from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). Specifically it comes from the [Digest of Education Statistics, Chap. 3, Section 313](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/2023menu_tables.asp)

# Inspiration
I am attempting to create a table similar to [HBCUs Overview by Tamas Varga](https://public.tableau.com/views/HBCUsOverview/HBCUsOverview?:language=en-US&utm_campaign=amer_tabaw&utm_medium=organic_social&:sid=&utm_content=tableaupublic_&utm_source=twitter&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) (shared to Tableau Public). Varga did not share their data or the source, so I went searching for somehting similar and stubmted on the NCES data.
