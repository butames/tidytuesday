  &nbsp;30 Day Chart Challenge&nbsp;
</h1>

<p>
As part of my continued effort to become conversant with using R, data manipulation, and creating data visuals, I am going to attempt to take part in the the annual **30DayChartChallenge**. This is my second challenge, after the DuBois Challenge (2024 Edition), and in addition to the TidyTuesday. This is such a large community with people doing amazing things. I am hoping I can keep up. 

Per the project website,
> Anyone is welcome to contribute, no matter which data source or tool you use. If you share your contributions on *X* or *bsky*, please use the hashtag #30DayChartChallenge and/or tag the @30DayChartCall account.

I will try to do it every week if I can. Whatever the case the visual documents I am able to create will be shown right here.

<p>
